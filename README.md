# Shared Workflows

This repository contains some reusable workflows which I'm using in various GitHub Actions in my repositories.

## Disclaimer

Those workflows might change from time to time and probably need some adjustments in the used actions to keep them working.

Some workflows might also be renamed if it makes some more sense to me. I could even remove them completely if I'm not using them anymore.

If you also want to use those workflows, I strongly recommend to use the commit hash (SHA1) of the corresponding commit. In that case, my changes won't break your actions.
